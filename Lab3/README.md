# Lab 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

###  Objective
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Mobile Price Classification dataset. This involves checking for missing values, understanding data distributions, and discovering relationships between mobile specifications and their price range.

###  Key Visualizations & Findings
During this lab, the following analyses were conducted:
* **Data Cleaning Checks:** Verified the dataset shape and confirmed there are no missing or duplicate values.
* **Feature Distributions:** Plotted histograms to understand the spread of key features like `battery_power` and `ram`.
* **Price Range Analysis:** Grouped data to show how average RAM and Battery Capacity increase across higher price categories.
* **Correlation Matrix:** Generated a heatmap to visualize the statistical relationships between features, highlighting `ram` as the strongest predictor of `price_range`.
